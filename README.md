### Kia ora ðŸ‘‹, my name is Taiao
#### I'm on a mission to become a full-stack web developer.

I'm studying web dev full-time at Developers Institute NZ and working hard on my school projects (you can check out my commits!).

- ðŸ”­ In my spare time i'm spicing up my [portfolio website](https://taiao.dev)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and React âš¡ 
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking for collaborative open source projects, particularly beginner-friendly ones, to get some more hands-on experience. 

Feel free to give me a shout! I'm always happy to chat, network, and learn from others.
