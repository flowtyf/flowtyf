### Kia ora ðŸ‘‹, my name is Taiao
#### I'm on a mission to become a full-stack web developer.

I'm currently studying full time at Developers Institute NZ. My github is quite empty - but you'll see from my commits I'm working hard in my school project repos.

- ðŸ”­ Right now I'm working on my portfolio website in my spare time 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and React âš¡ 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! I'd love to get my feet wet with any beginner-friendly issues you might have on your projects. 

Feel free to give me a shout! I'm always happy to chat, network, and learn from others.
